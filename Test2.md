# **Testing Documentation for Mynthra Project**

## **Overview**
This document outlines the testing approach, tools, and methodologies used for the Mynthra e-commerce project. The objective is to ensure that the platform meets the required functionality, performance, and security standards.

## **Testing Strategy**

### **1. Unit Testing**
- Validates the functionality of individual modules or components, such as:
  - User authentication (login, registration).
  - Cart operations (add, remove, update quantity).
  - Order placement logic.

### **2. Integration Testing**
- Verifies that modules interact correctly with each other:
  - User authentication with database operations.
  - Payment gateway integration with the checkout process.

### **3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
- Simulates real-world user scenarios to ensure the entire flow works as expected:
  - User registration to product purchase.
  - Browsing products, adding to cart, and completing payment.

### **4. Performance Testing**
- Evaluates system performance under expected and peak loads:
  - Page load times.
  - System behavior with 1000+ concurrent users.

### **5. Security Testing**
- Ensures data integrity and protection against threats:
  - Password encryption validation.
  - Secure payment processing.

### **6. UI/UX Testing**
- Validates the responsiveness and usability of the platform:
  - Mobile and desktop compatibility.
  - Accessibility standards compliance.
