Testing Guide for Mynthra E-Commerce Platform
This document outlines the testing process, including test cases, types of testing performed, and instructions for running the test suite for the Mynthra e-commerce platform.


1. Testing Overview

   
The testing strategy for the Mynthra e-commerce platform is designed to ensure that the system is reliable, functional, and user-friendly across its core features. Each type of testing targets a specific aspect of the platform to identify and fix issues before deployment, ensuring a seamless experience for users. Below is an in-depth explanation of each testing type included in the strategy:

1.1 Unit Testing
Objective:
Unit testing focuses on verifying the functionality of individual components or modules in isolation. This ensures that each unit performs as expected under various conditions.

Key Focus Areas:

Testing functions, methods, and classes in isolation.
Ensuring components like user authentication, product search, and cart management function correctly.
Validating edge cases such as invalid user inputs or empty cart scenarios.
Tools:

Jest, Mocha, or any chosen unit testing framework.
1.2 Integration Testing
Objective:
Integration testing ensures that multiple modules or components work together as expected. It tests the interactions between various subsystems like the frontend, backend, and database.

Key Focus Areas:

Verifying the interaction between user registration forms and the authentication API.
Testing the product catalog's connection to the database for accurate search and filter functionalities.
Ensuring payment processing integrates seamlessly with third-party payment gateways.
Tools:

Postman for API testing.
Mocha/Chai or other integration testing frameworks.
1.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing
Objective:
E2E testing simulates real-world user journeys to ensure the entire system functions correctly from start to finish. This type of testing validates the workflow as experienced by end-users.

Key Focus Areas:

Simulating user registration, product browsing, and order placement.
Testing the full checkout process, including payment and order confirmation.
Ensuring order tracking updates reflect real-time statuses accurately.
Tools:

Cypress or Selenium for automating user journey simulations.
1.4 Performance Testing
Objective:
Performance testing evaluates the platform’s responsiveness, speed, and stability under normal and peak load conditions. It identifies bottlenecks and ensures scalability.

Key Focus Areas:

Measuring page load times for the product catalog and checkout pages.
Testing the platform’s ability to handle high traffic, such as 1000+ concurrent users.
Evaluating the backend’s response times for search queries and order placements.
Tools:

Apache JMeter, Lighthouse, or Google Chrome DevTools.
1.5 Security Testing
Objective:
Security testing ensures that the platform is safeguarded against vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and data breaches.

Key Focus Areas:

Validating secure data transmission (encryption at rest and in transit).
Testing against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.
Verifying secure password storage and recovery mechanisms.
Tools:

OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or manual penetration testing.
1.6 UI/UX Testing
Objective:
UI/UX testing evaluates the platform’s user interface and experience to ensure it is intuitive, responsive, and accessible.

Key Focus Areas:

Testing the responsiveness of the UI across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Verifying the accessibility of the platform, such as compatibility with screen readers and adherence to WCAG standards.
Ensuring smooth navigation across user workflows like browsing, cart management, and checkout.
Tools:

BrowserStack for cross-device testing.
Lighthouse for assessing usability and accessibility metrics.
