## 1. Overview
Myntra 2.0 is a next-generation e-commerce platform for fashion and lifestyle products. The platform is built to provide a seamless user experience, ensuring scalability, performance, and security. The system is developed using a **microservices architecture** with a responsive, user-friendly **frontend**. It supports essential features like user authentication, product browsing, cart management, order processing, and payment integration.

## 2. System Architecture
The system follows a **microservices-based architecture** for flexibility, maintainability, and scalability. Below is a high-level view of the architecture:

### **Frontend**
- **Technologies**: ReactJS, Redux, TailwindCSS, Axios
- **Role**: Handles user interaction, provides dynamic and responsive web pages, and communicates with the backend via REST APIs.

### **Backend**
- **Technologies**: Node.js, FastAPI (Python), Docker, Kubernetes
- **Microservices**:
  - **User Service**: Manages user authentication and profile data.
  - **Product Service**: Manages product catalog, filters, and categories.
  - **Order Service**: Handles cart, checkout, payments, and order tracking.
  - **Recommendation Service**: Provides AI-based product recommendations.
  - **Notification Service**: Sends email, SMS, and app notifications.

### **Databases**
- **PostgreSQL**: For relational data (users, orders, payments, etc.).  
- **MongoDB**: For product catalog, product details, and inventory.  
- **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data like user sessions and cart details.  

### **Deployment**
- **Containerization**: Docker for containerizing services.  
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for scaling and managing containers.  
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (Amazon Web Services) for hosting.

## 3. Design Principles
The following principles guide the development and design of Myntra 2.0:

- **Modularity**: Independent services for better maintainability.  
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through container orchestration (Kubernetes).  
- **Security**: Role-based access control (RBAC), secure payment handling, and encrypted user data.  
- **Performance**: Use of Redis caching, load balancers, and optimized database queries.  
- **Responsiveness**: A mobile-first approach for a smooth, fast experience on all devices.
