**Prompt 1:**  "Create a System Context Diagram for Mynthra 2.0, showing key stakeholders (Shoppers, Vendors, Admins) and external systems (Payment Gateway, Logistics API, SMS/Email Service, Inventory, Analytics). Illustrate their interactions with the platform, such as browsing, purchasing, product management, payments, and delivery tracking."

**Prompt 2:** "Create a Container Diagram for Mynthra 2.0, showing key components like Web App, Mobile App, API Gateway, and backend services (Product, User, Cart, Order, Payment, etc.). Include databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL), external systems (Payment Gateway, Logistics API, SMS/Email), and illustrate how these components interact through APIs, databases, and message queues."

**Prompt 3:** "component diagram for vendor and admin and shopper  for myntra app give plant uml code in heavy details"

**Prompt 4:** "create deployement diagram for myntra app*

**File Name:** `test.md` 

**Prompt:**  "Create a comprehensive test plan for Myntra 2.0, a revamped e-commerce platform. Include details on the testing scope, objectives, strategies, and environment configuration. Break down testing into modules like Customer Module, Product Module, Order Management, and Admin tasks. Also, describe test cases and test types like unit, integration, and performance testing"

**File Name:** `Stakeholders.md` 

**Prompt:**  "Identify key stakeholders for Myntra 2.0, an e-commerce platform, and describe their roles and responsibilities. Provide insights into how their involvement impacts various stages of the development process and ensure their needs align with project goals."

**File Name:** `CrossReferenceMatrix.md` 

**Prompt:**  "Develop a Cross Reference Matrix for Myntra 2.0, showing the relationships between requirements and the corresponding test cases, ensuring traceability and full coverage during testing. Represent this in a tabular format."

**File Name:** `SRS.md`

**Prompt:**  "Write a concise Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for an e-commerce platform named 'Mynthra.' Follow the IEEE SRS format and include the following sections:

Introduction: Briefly describe the purpose, scope, and key definitions.
Overall Description: Summarize the product perspective, main functions, user types, operating environment, and constraints.
System Features: List key features (e.g., user registration, product browsing, payment processing) with functional requirements.
External Interfaces: Outline user, hardware, software, and communication interfaces.
Use Cases: Provide use cases for shoppers, vendors, and admins, focusing on preconditions and main flows.
Non-Functional Requirements: Highlight performance, security, scalability, and usability needs.
Conclusion: Summarize the document’s objective and relevance.
Make the content clear, professional, and concise, ensuring all stakeholders understand the platform's requirements."

**File Name:** `Project.md`

**Prompt:**
"give refference how to make project md for a clone"

**Prompt:** "check and fix spelling mistakes"
