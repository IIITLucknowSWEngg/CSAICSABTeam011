## Prompts Used
**File Name:** `URD.md` 

**Prompt:**  "Create a User Requirements Document (URD) for Mynthra 2.0, an e-commerce platform. The document should define key user personas with their demographics, needs, goals, and tech skills. It should include user stories for their main actions on the platform and provide use cases for features like registration, product management, and admin tasks."


**File Name:** `Architecture.md` 

**Prompt 1:**  "Create a System Context Diagram for Mynthra 2.0, showing key stakeholders (Shoppers, Vendors, Admins) and external systems (Payment Gateway, Logistics API, SMS/Email Service, Inventory, Analytics). Illustrate their interactions with the platform, such as browsing, purchasing, product management, payments, and delivery tracking."

**Prompt 2:** "Create a Container Diagram for Mynthra 2.0, showing key components like Web App, Mobile App, API Gateway, and backend services (Product, User, Cart, Order, Payment, etc.). Include databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL), external systems (Payment Gateway, Logistics API, SMS/Email), and illustrate how these components interact through APIs, databases, and message queues.

**File Name:** `test.md` 

**Prompt:**  "Create a comprehensive test plan for Myntra 2.0, a revamped e-commerce platform. Include details on the testing scope, objectives, strategies, and environment configuration. Break down testing into modules like Customer Module, Product Module, Order Management, and Admin tasks. Also, describe test cases and test types like unit, integration, and performance testing"

**File Name:** `Stakeholders.md` 

**Prompt:**  "Identify key stakeholders for Myntra 2.0, an e-commerce platform, and describe their roles and responsibilities. Provide insights into how their involvement impacts various stages of the development process and ensure their needs align with project goals."

**File Name:** `CrossReferenceMatrix.md` 

**Prompt:**  "Develop a Cross Reference Matrix for Myntra 2.0, showing the relationships between requirements and the corresponding test cases, ensuring traceability and full coverage during testing. Represent this in a tabular format."
