Project Overview
Myntra is a prominent fashion and lifestyle e-commerce platform that offers a vast selection of clothing, accessories, footwear, and other lifestyle products. With its user-friendly interface, Myntra allows customers to browse through products, filter by categories, and make purchases seamlessly. The platform supports personalized recommendations, multiple payment options, and real-time order tracking, enhancing the shopping experience for users.

In this project, we aim to replicate core functionalities of the Myntra platform to better understand the software development process for e-commerce websites. The focus will be on implementing features such as user registration, product catalog browsing, shopping cart management, and order placement. This project is a mock implementation intended for learning purposes rather than creating a fully functional Myntra clone.
